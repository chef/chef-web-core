<h1>Brand Guidelines</h1>
<p class="lead">
  Consistency in how we refer to our company and products is important. All of
  your questions should be answered below.
</p>
<h2>Logos</h2>
<p>
  The Chef logo means a lot of things to a lot of people. It is an emblem championing open source software and its community. It is a seal of quality and a stamp of approval from the company. Therefore it should be used proudly, consistently, and with great meaning.
</p>
<p>
  The Chef logo is always vertical. Even in horizontal layouts, such as banners or headers, the logo remains in the vertical layout. This is integral to consistency and brand recognition. Additionally, the circular logo and the name must always appear together. In some designed cases, the circular logo may appear by itself but these instances are few and far between.
</p>
<h3>Download a Logo</h3>
<p>
  <% link_to image_path("source/chef-logo.ai"), :class => "button secondary",
       :download => "logo.ai" do %>
    <i class="fi-download"></i>
    logo.ai
  <% end %>
  <% link_to image_path("logo-vert-dark.svg"), :class => "button secondary",
      :download => "logo.svg" do %>
    <i class="fi-download"></i>
    logo.svg
  <% end %>
</p>
<p> 
  The messaging under the logo can read one of three options: CODE CAN, CHEF.IO, or remain blank. Under no circumstances may something else be displayed in that area.
  If you see the logo with something else written beneath Chef, please alert someone on the marketing team immediately.
</p>
